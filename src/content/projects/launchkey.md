LaunchKey helps companies find, vet, and engage partners in overseas markets with Firebase, Gemini, Gmail and Maps.

**My role:** turning GTM workflow logic into a seamless product experience.

The part I love? The puzzle of process-to-product design:

- How should users move through this workflow?
- What layouts display options and information in a clean, intuitive way?
- How do I keep everything in one place—no extra pages, no unnecessary clicks?

## My Toolkit for Speed

**Mobbin** — browsed real B2B patterns for inspiration.

**Stitch** — stitched reference designs together to build wireframes fast.

**Google AI Studio** — turned wireframes into working UI code, ready for integration.

## My Design Workflow

business process → inspiration → wireframes → code
