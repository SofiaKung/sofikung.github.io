Won 2nd Place at the APAC Art x Tech Hackathon.

**The challenge:** Display 78 tarot cards on a mobile screen without losing the immersive, personal feeling of a real reading.

**My solution:** An infinite depth scroll that arranges the entire deck into a spiral tunnel. As you scroll, you travel through the cards. An AI voice guide walks you through the draw, then delivers a personalized reading based on your question and chosen cards.

## Tech Stack

- **React Three Fiber** — 3D spatial architecture
- **OpenAI + n8n** — cat-themed tarot card generation
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** — contextual readings
- **ElevenLabs** — immersive voice narration

This project sits at the intersection of what I love: solving creative UI constraints and adopting AI tools to create experiences that feel magical.
