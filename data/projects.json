      "As part of Singapore's Smart Nation Initiative, the nation's public data is made available on open data portals for decision makers to monitor and gain insights about Singaporeâ€™s social and economic trends.",
      "Due to the lack of a proper tool to visualize these data, the public is unable to harness the value of these data. To address this issue, we created GeViz, an interactive visual analytics dashboard for the public and ministries of Singapore to uncover insights on Singapore government's procurement spending, with the aim to identify procurement needs of Singapore government, spending patterns, as well as, relationships between ministries and suppliers.",
