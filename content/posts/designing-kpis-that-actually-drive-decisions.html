<p>Good KPIs tell you what to do next. In this post, I break down a pragmatic approach to selecting metrics that drive decisions instead of dashboards that gather dust.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>KPIs must map to an action owner and cadence.</li>
  <li>Prefer rate or ratio metrics over raw counts.</li>
  <li>Instrument counter-metrics to catch unintended consequences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>For each KPI: definition, owner, target, review cadence, and playbook.</p>
